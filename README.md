Building this repo for the first time will take about 90 seconds, but reconnecting in the future is essentially instantaneous.

*Note: although 'racket-langserver' appears to crash on startup, Racket files still compile and run. This is a known error, but every attempt to fix this pesky message has been curiously unsuccessful (as can be seen by commented-out lines in the .devcontainer directory). Please feel free to submit any and all recommendations!*
